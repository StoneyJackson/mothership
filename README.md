The Mothership will be a website that supports a community of educators developing a curriculum of course materials for teaching open-source development using open-source tools and practices. The website will allow community members to find, request, share, organize, and improve open educational materials that are published in various forges. The website will help the community members stay motivated, connected, and engaged by raising its members awareness of members' activities.

## Users

Mothership users are primarily faculty with masters and doctorates in computer science, mathematics, or other related disciplines. Their experience with open source tools and practices will vary from none to a lot. But most will be closer to the "none" end of the spectrum. They have very limited time, as their primary responsibility is to teach their courses, conduct research, and dispatch other faculty duties.

Community members are motivated to develop course materials in an open-source way for the following reasons:

- To learn the tools and practices that they intend to teach.
- To benefit from contributions to their work by community members.
- To benefit from the collection of materials created by the community.
- To feel good about contributing to a larger community.
