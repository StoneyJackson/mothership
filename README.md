# Mothership

Faculty need to gain experience with open source tools and practices to better teach them to students, but lack the time to work on an open source software project. Also, faculty need materials to teach open source tools and practices. We suggest solving both of these problems at the same time by having faculty develop materials using open source tools and practices.

Imagine an open educator community that develops and maintains open course materials using common open source tools and practices. This community will make their open materials available using forge services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitorious, etc. However, this community will need a mechanism for finding materials being shared by others in the community. This is the purpose of Mothership. Mothership will be a website that serves a community of educators wanting to share, find, and contribute to open source educational materials for teaching open source tools and practices.
