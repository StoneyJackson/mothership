- Self-hosted
  - Allows customization
  - Greater control
  - No dependence on an external organization

### Custom-Code vs No-Custom-Code

- No-Custom-Code
  - No development time required

### Custom-Configuration vs No-Custom-Configuration

- Custom-Configuration
  - Can get it to do what you want (maybe)
- No-Custom-Configuration
  - No time spent customizing

### Open-Source vs Closed-Source

- Open-Source

  - Can customize on self-hosted
- Closed-Source

### Human-Moderated vs Auto-Moderated

- Human-Moderated
  - Greater control over membership and/or content
  - Often simpler system (code-wise)
  - Prevents spam
- Auto-Moderated
  - Requires less human resources and/or distributes effort over the community
  - Increased sense of fairness and openness as either a community is moderating (vs one person moderating) or moderation is blind and systematic (e.g., must prove you are human and confirm an email to get an account).
