# Users

## Educators

Educators are the primary users. They create, share, and use open educational materials using tools and processes used to develop open source software. They do this for several reasons.

- They want to participate in open-source development
- They want to find and use materials made by others for use in their courses
- They want to share they want to give-back or pay-it-forward, realizing that they were able to find and use resources in their courses because someone else shared their materials in the first place.
- They want to help improve materials created by others because they use those same materials.
- They want to maintain the materials they share because they are using them in their own classes.
- They want to receive help from others to improve materials they maintain because they use those materials in their class.

## Directors

Directors are secondary users in the sense that there are probably fewer of them. Directors maintain the systems of the community of educators, set policy/guidelines for the community, and generally guide the community.
